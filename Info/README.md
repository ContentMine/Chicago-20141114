#Pre-workshop installation instructions
ContentMine workshop @ SciDataCon, 2 Nov 2014

###Introduction

The workshop will involve some hands-on exercises using the ContentMine software. We have
pre-made a virtual machine containing all the software, so that attendees can run it without having
to modify their own systems.

Before the workshop, all attendees should do the following:

- Download and install VirtualBox
- Download the ContentMine virtual machine image

###1. VirtualBox

Please download the VirtualBox platform installer for your operating system from the VirtualBox
[website] (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

###2. ContentMine virtual machine image

Please download the [virtual image] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/rie9l8m1v4fdqha/ContentMine.ova). Note, this is a large file: ~1.8GB!

When the file is downloaded, double-clicking it should open VirtualBox and offer to import the
virtual machine. Please follow the on-screen instructions to complete the import.

When this is done, you’re ready for the workshop!

###Troubleshooting

If you have any problems getting VirtualBox installed, or downloading and importing the virtual
image, don’t worry. We’ll set aside a short period of time at the beginning of the workshop to make
sure everyone has access to a machine that can run the exercises.
