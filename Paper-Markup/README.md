# Paper markup exercise

As an exercise to introduce some concepts in content mining we will do a hands-on exercise in which we manually mine data from a scientific paper.

The paper can be found [here](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/14/70)

 * You will be provided with paper copies of pages from a scientific article. Although the subject matter is technical, you should be able to carry out this exercise without any deep scientific knowledge.
 * Work in about 4 groups of up to 6 people. Each person has a different highlighter pen to markup up *entities* in the article. How to colour-code the entities is explained below.
 * Mark up the first ten previously unseen entities in each page starting at the top. Swap the pages within the group so each gets exposed to every marker pen. Mark only the entity (i.e. not the context).

### Entities

An entity is a complete nounal word or phrase which can/could be found in a systematic taxonomy or definition. 
Thus "1984", "Pleistocene", "5 minutes" could be marked as date/times, while "recently" would be too fuzzy. 
*Where there is ambiguity, try to consider whether others would vote the same way*.

*For each entity type try to formulate the rules that you used and whether they could be computerised.* Examples are:

* syntactic context "The *foo* lives in *bar*" 
* lexical makeup of words
* style/fonts
* lookup in authorities (e.g. Wikimedia)
* computability - can the entity be analysed algorithmically?

Add your answers to the Etherpad.

### Types of entity

* **YELLOW**: Species and Genera. use only precise terms (e.g. omit generic terms such as "pets"). 
* **ORANGE**: Places. Anything that resolves to a usefully defined point or region. "London", Latitude+Longitude, not "further north". Exclude metadata
* **PURPLE**: Date/times. Resolvable to an ISO 8601 datetime or an ontologically supported concept ("Eocene", "equinoctual"). Not "recently".
Exclude metadata.
* **PINK**: Identifiers. Formal codes given by authorities, e..g PMIDs, Genbank IDS. 
* **CYAN**: Bibliographic and academic metadata, including rights, grants. Indicate precise lengths of phrase and constant/variable 
components
* **GREEN**: Chemical compounds. Resolvable in PubChem, or of generic chemical form. Not "diesel oil", "butter".

### Precision and Recall

When your group has finished swap your sheets with a neighbouring group. Critique *their* markup, drawing a circle round where you
disagree - either for an omission ("false negative") or a wrongly marked entity ("false positive").

*Note there is NO absolutely right or wrong answer*, there is only inter-annotator dis/agreement. The better the agreement the higher scores we should expect from programmatic output. 

Note also this is very tedious and generally impossible without Open material. Humans have to:

* write and agree the rules. We wrote 31 pages of rules to interpret chemistry.
* have several people independently mark up a test corpus. Calculate the interannotator agreement. We got 92% for chemistry.
* write a program and train it against a traing corpus (more work).
* use a validation corpus (even more work) to test how well the program performs.
