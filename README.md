### Documentation

The primary means of communication and taking notes during the workshop will be via this [Etherpad] (http://pads.cottagelabs.com/p/contentmine_chicago2014). 

If you're not familiar with Etherpads, it's easy - you just type! Your writing will show up in a different colour to other people's and you can associate the colour with your name by clicking the person icon in the top right corner of the screen.
